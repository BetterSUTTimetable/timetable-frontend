# Better timetable

## Requirements 
* node ^4.2.6
* npm ^3.5.2
* [See more https://nodejs.org/en/]

## How to run
* npm install [call from app dir]
* bower install [call from app dir]
* npm install -g http-server [-g means globally]
* http-server [finally! call from app dir]

## Tips
* It will be better for you if you turn off your browser cache during development :) 
* You don't need to restart http-server if you change something - just reload browser or ctrl + shift + r
